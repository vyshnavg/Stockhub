    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <hr>
    <h4 style="text-align:justify;">The people who want to find out the raw materials required to make the end-product can do so by just typing out the name of the product in the  <a href="<?php echo base_url();?>home">homepage</a>.<br><br> 
Stockhub will show them the various <a href="<?php echo base_url();?>materials">raw materials</a> that can be used and the advantages and disadvantages of using each of them. This will give them a clarity of the materials that will be required and once that is achieved, the second function of the website starts.<br><br>
A tender can be created to procure the product. The notification will be broadcasted to every vendor who deals with these materials. All this will create a network of interactions and save tons of research
